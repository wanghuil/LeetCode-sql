175. Combine Two Tables
Easy

SQL Schema
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
 

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State

SELECT firstname, 
       lastname, 
       city, 
       state 
FROM   person 
       LEFT JOIN address 
              ON person.personid = address.personid; 
              
            
176. Second Highest Salary
Easy

SQL Schema
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

SELECT isnull( 
       ( 
                       SELECT DISTINCT salary 
                       FROM            employee 
                       ORDER BY        salary DESC 
                       offset          1 rows 
                       FETCH next 1 rows only ), NULL) AS secondhighestsalary
    
    
181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
Easy

SQL Schema
The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+

SELECT a.name AS 'Employee' 
FROM   employee AS a, 
       employee AS b 
WHERE  a.managerid = b.id 
       AND a.salary > b.salary; 
       

182. Duplicate Emails
Easy

SQL Schema
Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Note: All emails are in lowercase.

SELECT email 
FROM   person 
GROUP  BY email 
HAVING Count(email) > 1; 


183. Customers Who Never Order
Easy

SQL Schema
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

SELECT NAME 'Customers' 
FROM   customers c 
       LEFT JOIN orders o 
              ON c.id = o.customerid 
WHERE  o.customerid IS NULL 
ORDER  BY NAME ASC; 


196. Delete Duplicate Emails
Easy

Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Note:

Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.

DELETE a 
FROM   person a, 
       person b 
WHERE  a.email = b.email 
       AND a.id > b.id; 
   
   
197. Rising Temperature
Easy

SQL Schema
Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |

586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders
Easy

SQL Schema
Query the customer_number from the orders table for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The orders table is defined as follows:

| Column            | Type      |
|-------------------|-----------|
| order_number (PK) | int       |
| customer_number   | int       |

Sample Output

| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |
Explanation

The customer with number '3' has two orders, which is greater than either customer '1' or '2' because each of them  only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number '3'.
Follow up: What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?

SELECT customer_number 
FROM   orders 
GROUP  BY customer_number 
ORDER  BY Count(order_number) DESC 
LIMIT  1; 

follow up question:
SELECT customer_number 
FROM   orders 
GROUP  BY customer_number 
HAVING Count(order_number) = (SELECT Max(numoforder) 
                              FROM   (SELECT customer_number, 
                                             Count(order_number) AS numOfOrder 
                                      FROM   orders 
                                      GROUP  BY customer_number) AS a)

+-----------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------+
A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million square km or a population of more than 25 million.

Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area.

For example, according to the above table, we should output:

+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| name         | population  | area         |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan  | 25500100    | 652230       |
| Algeria      | 37100000    | 2381741      |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+

SELECT name, 
       population, 
       area 
FROM   world 
WHERE  ( area / 1000000 ) > 3 
        OR ( population / 1000000 ) > 25; 
        
        
596. Classes More Than 5 Students
Easy

SQL Schema
There is a table courses with columns: student and class

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

For example, the table:

+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |

| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
Should output:

+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
 

Note:
The students should not be counted duplicate in each course.

SELECT class 
FROM   courses 
GROUP  BY class 
HAVING Count(DISTINCT student) >= 5; 

597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate
Easy

SQL Schema
In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others’ requests as well. Now given two tables as below:
 

Table: friend_request
| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |
| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |
| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |
 

Table: request_accepted
| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |
 

Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.
 

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.
 

|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|
 

Note:
The accepted requests are not necessarily from the table friend_request. In this case, you just need to simply count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the acceptance rate.
It is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same receiver, and a request could be accepted more than once. In this case, the ‘duplicated’ requests or acceptances are only counted once.
If there is no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the accept_rate.
 

Explanation: There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total. So the rate is 0.80.
 

Follow-up:
Can you write a query to return the accept rate but for every month?
How about the cumulative accept rate for every day?

SELECT Round(Ifnull((SELECT Count(*) 
                     FROM   (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, 
                                             accepter_id 
                             FROM   request_accepted) AS b) / (SELECT Count(*) 
                                                               FROM 
                                 (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id,

Explanation

According to order '3' and '4' in table orders, it is easy to tell only salesperson 'John' and 'Pam' have sales to company 'RED',
so we need to output all the other names in the table salesperson.

SELECT sa.name 
FROM   salesperson sa 
WHERE  sa.sales_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT s.sales_id 
                           FROM   salesperson s 
                                  LEFT JOIN orders o 
                                         ON s.sales_id = o.sales_id 
                                  LEFT JOIN company c 
                                         ON c.com_id = o.com_id 
                           WHERE  c.name = 'RED'); 
                           
                           
610. Triangle Judgement
Easy

SQL Schema
A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.
 

However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.
 

Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.
 

| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
       
       
SELECT x, 
       y, 
       z, 
       CASE 
         WHEN x + y > z 
              AND x + z > y 
              AND y + z > x THEN 'Yes' 
         ELSE 'No' 
       end AS 'triangle' 
FROM   triangle; 


613. Shortest Distance in a Line
Easy

SQL Schema
Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
 

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
 

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 

| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
 

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.
 

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

SELECT Min(d) AS 'shortest' 
FROM   (SELECT Abs(a.x - b.x) AS d 
        FROM   point a 
               JOIN point b 
                 ON a.x != b.x) AS c; 
                 
follow up:
SELECT Min(b.x - a.x) AS shortest 
FROM   point a, 
       point b 
WHERE  b.x > a.x 
LIMIT  1 


619. Biggest Single Number
Easy

SQL Schema
Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
Note:
If there is no such number, just output null.

SELECT Ifnull((SELECT Max(n) 
               FROM   (SELECT DISTINCT num AS n 
                       FROM   my_numbers 
                       GROUP  BY num 
                       HAVING Count(num) = 1) AS a), NULL) AS 'num'; 
                       
                       
620. Not Boring Movies
Easy

+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
For the example above, the output should be:
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+

FROM   cinema 
WHERE  description != 'boring' 
       AND MOD(id, 2) = 1 
ORDER  BY id DESC; 


627. Swap Salary
Easy

SQL Schema
Given a table salary, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temp table.

Note that you must write a single update statement, DO NOT write any select statement for this problem.

 

Example:

| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
After running your update statement, the above salary table should have the following rows:
| id | name | sex | salary |
|----|------|-----|--------|
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |

UPDATE salary 
SET    sex = CASE sex 
               WHEN 'm' THEN 'f' 
               ELSE 'm' 
             end;

+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.

1173. Immediate Food Delivery I
Easy

SQL Schema
Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called immediate otherwise it's called scheduled.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |

Result table:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 33.33                |
+----------------------+
The orders with delivery id 2 and 3 are immediate while the others are scheduled.

SELECT Round((SELECT Count(*) 
              FROM   delivery 
              WHERE  order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) /

1179. Reformat Department Table
Easy

SQL Schema
Table: Department

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| revenue       | int     |
| month         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
 

Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

The query result format is in the following example:

Department table:
+------+---------+-------+
| id   | revenue | month |
+------+---------+-------+
| 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
| 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
| 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
| 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
| 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
+------+---------+-------+

Result table:
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
| 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
| 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+

Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).

SELECT id, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Jan' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Jan_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Feb' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Feb_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Mar' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Mar_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Apr' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Apr_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month`

       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Jun' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Jun_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Jul' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Jul_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Aug' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Aug_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Sep' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Sep_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Oct' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Oct_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Nov' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Nov_Revenue, 
       Sum(CASE `month` 
             WHEN 'Dec' THEN revenue 
             ELSE NULL 
           end) AS Dec_Revenue

1211. Queries Quality and Percentage
Easy

SQL Schema
Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write an SQL query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+

Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

SELECT query_name, 
       Round(Avg(rating / position), 2)                         quality, 
       Round(( Sum(IF(rating < 3, 1, 0)) / Count(*) ) * 100, 2) 
       poor_query_percentage 
FROM   queries 
GROUP  BY query_name; 


1241. Number of Comments per Post
Easy

SQL Schema
Table: Submissions

+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| sub_id        | int      |
| parent_id     | int      |
+---------------+----------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row can be a post or comment on the post.
parent_id is null for posts.
parent_id for comments is sub_id for another post in the table.
 

Write an SQL query to find number of comments per each post.

Result table should contain post_id and its corresponding number_of_comments, and must be sorted by post_id in ascending order.

Submissions may contain duplicate comments. You should count the number of unique comments per post.

Submissions may contain duplicate posts. You should treat them as one post.

The query result format is in the following example:

Submissions table:
+---------+------------+
| sub_id  | parent_id  |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Null       |
| 2       | Null       |
| 1       | Null       |
| 12      | Null       |
| 3       | 1          |
| 5       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 4       | 1          |
| 9       | 1          |
| 10      | 2          |
| 6       | 7          |
+---------+------------+

Result table:
+---------+--------------------+
| post_id | number_of_comments |
+---------+--------------------+
| 1       | 3                  |
| 2       | 2                  |
| 12      | 0                  |
+---------+--------------------+

The post with id 1 has three comments in the table with id 3, 4 and 9. The comment with id 3 is repeated in the table, we counted it only once.
The post with id 2 has two comments in the table with id 5 and 10.
The post with id 12 has no comments in the table.
The comment with id 6 is a comment on a deleted post with id 7 so we ignored it.

SELECT post_id, 
       Count(DISTINCT S2.sub_id) AS number_of_comments 
FROM   (SELECT DISTINCT sub_id AS post_id 
        FROM   submissions 
        WHERE  parent_id IS NULL) S1 
       LEFT JOIN submissions S2 
              ON S1.post_id = S2.parent_id 
GROUP  BY S1.post_id

| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

Table: UnitsSold

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units and product_id of each product sold. 
 

Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product.

average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |

| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
+------------+---------------+-------+

Result table:
+------------+---------------+
| product_id | average_price |
+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

SELECT a.product_id, 
       Round(Sum(a.units * b.price) / Sum(a.units), 2) AS average_price 
FROM   unitssold a 
       JOIN prices b 
         ON ( a.product_id = b.product_id 
              AND a.purchase_date >= b.start_date
